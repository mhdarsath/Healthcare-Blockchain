 🏥 Healthcare Blockchain

📌 **Overview**
This project is a **blockchain prototype in Python** built for the **healthcare domain**.
It demonstrates how blockchain can securely record and manage **patient medical records**, diagnoses, and treatments.

---

🎯 **Objective**

* Securely store patient medical data.
* Prevent tampering of health records with immutable blockchain entries.
* Ensure only authorized access to sensitive medical data.
* Provide transparency and traceability for hospitals, doctors, and patients.

---

🛠️ **Features**

* Add patient records such as diagnoses and treatments.
* Store multiple records in each block.
* Use **SHA-256 hashing** for tamper-proof storage.
* Maintain a blockchain ledger of all medical history.

---

💻 **Technologies Used**

* **Python 3**
* **Hashlib** (for SHA-256 hashing)
* **JSON** (for structured patient data)

---

📜 **Example Records**

* Patient John is diagnosed with Flu by Dr. Smith and prescribed medication.
* Patient Alice is diagnosed with Diabetes by Dr. Lee and given insulin treatment.

---

✅ **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **blockchain can improve healthcare** by making medical data:

* **Secure** → Cryptographic hashes prevent record tampering.
* **Transparent** → Patients and doctors can verify history.
* **Trustworthy** → Builds confidence in hospitals and digital healthcare systems.

Blockchain has the potential to create **secure, efficient, and reliable healthcare record systems** for the future.
